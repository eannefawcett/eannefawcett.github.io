The word science illicits images of plants and microbiomes, the color changes from chemical reactions and Bohr's atomic models, and systems interacting kinetically and on the quantum level. Data science, however, drives these dancing figures to a halt as numbers take over. Data science is the creation of a visual developed from interpreted data for the purposes of making informed decisions based on analysis. From a research standpoint, this data science perspective addresses the primary goal of all research: how can I display what I have discovered in order to communicate to various audiences effectively? With this connection in place, there must be additional similarities between what I know as a scientist and what I don't know as a data scientist. To discover where these points of overlap are, I will evaluate the method by which each discipline is practiced.

The scientific method is largely agreed on by the scientific community as the following:

Typically, the process starts with an internal observation of the world followed by a question pertaining to the observation, generally sparked by curiosity. Then a hypothesis to test is derived from the question and observation, typically about a relationship that can be tested. Next, the studier will make a prediction about what will happen when testing occurs. Subsequently this testing is designed and performed with the collection of data. This data is then evaluated and a working theory is developed. This results in starting the process over again or generating new observations based on the working theory.

The data science method is largely agreed on by the data science community as the following:

Conversely the data science method begins in a different place, with business understanding. This is an external filter brought to the studier to contextualize the question being asked by the client. The study that follows is typically commissioned by an outside party, that does not generally participate in the analysis phase except to define the scope of the analysis.
