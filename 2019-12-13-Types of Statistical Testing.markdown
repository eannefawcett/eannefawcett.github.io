# Types of Statistical Testing
First this topic must be addressed with how statistical testing works. It's a process that lives and breathes. There's always another test that can be done, so how do you know for sure that the conclusion is the most appropriate one? First, ensure that all variables to be addressed are being addressed appropriately. Then, once the variables have been isolated appropriately for testing, issues of variance in the data must be evaluated and managed accordingly. Next, is running the first test. This test is then followed by a confirmatory test and/or a non-parametric testing equivalent. Once this information has been ascertained it's time to give that information power by evaluating the volume and nature of the original data through effect sizes and power studies. Then, evaluation of error might be necessary. At this point, a conclusion might be reached, but more often, something has been illuminated that starts the questioning process all over again, and a new testing cycle is started.
