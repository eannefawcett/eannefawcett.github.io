I was born and raised in the Hill Country, south of Austin and north of San Antonio. I attended college at Schreiner University where I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry and a Bachelor's of Science in Biology. Post graduation I attended the University of North Texas Health Science Center in pursuit of a Doctorate of Osteopathy. I quickly learned that the path of medical doctor was not one that I wanted to pursue. I switched over from graduate school to a lab job that was medical adjacent in the field of molecular biology. We tested potential organ donors for infectious diseases. Working closely with my manager, I decided to invest in a Master's of Business Administration, which is still in progress. Due to a limited path for advancement in the lab I was working in, I began training to teach science at the high school level to support my passion for education. This passion was spurred on with the volunteer work I did with an organ procurement organization closely aligned with the infectious disease lab I worked for at the time.

 I attended college at Schreiner University where I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry and a Bachelor's of Science in Biology. In addition, I decided to invest in Data Science at Flatiron School, as well as a Master's of Business Administration, which is still in progress. My experiences in the lab, teaching, and the connections that I've made with other teachers have helped me realize my love of data science. Being in education gave me a view of what our future is going to look like in that data will most likely drive decisions for tomorrow.

 I actually feel that working in data science will only strengthen my background in chemistry by allowing me to look deeper into various issues. I look forward to the update from baby chemist to lab tech to teacher to data scientist.

The segments of my background that support data science come from my work in a molecular biology lab and teaching high school science. I have a passion for data analysis, which sets me apart from my peers, and has resulted in my transition into a career in data science.
