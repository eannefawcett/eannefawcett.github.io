Hello, and welcome to my portfolio landing page. Here you will find links and short descriptions to work that I have completed. It is organized first by date, and then by organization the task was completed for. Some of the works here will manifest similarly to a blog post about the task, others will be original content, and some have protected information, available upon reviewed request.

# 2020

### e9 Treatments

- [Product Recommendation -][e9-research]
This project explored collected data and used statistical testing to make a product recommendation based on predefined criteria.
- [Assay Development for Developed Product -][e9_etching_assay]
Contact for access to link.
- [Chemical Storage Design - ][e9_chemical_storage]
This post explains the process used to update a chemical stoage system.

### Flatiron School

- [Certificate of Completion for Data Science -](/files/Online_June_2020_Certs_Part28.pdf)
This certificate shows that I have over 500 hours investing in learning about data science and machine learning from Flatiron School.
- [Lexile Determination Project][lexile-determination], [Application][lexile-determination-app], and [Video -][lexile-determination-video]
This project uses NLP to classify a text's lexile level.
- [Classifying Gene Locus by Gene Composition Project][gene-classification] and [Video -][gene-classification-video]
This project uses a Random Forest model to predict at what location on a chromosome a gene will be located based on the genes composition.
- [ARIMA Model Using Zillow Housing Data -][time-series]
This project makes predictions about housing prices for major metropolitan areas in the state of Texas.
- [Northwind Database Exploration][sql-explore] and [Video -][sql-explore-video]
This project makes recommendations to increase revenue based on two factors increasing customer spending and reducing overhead.

# 2019

### Sunnyvale High School

### Flatiron School

- [King County Seattle Housing][eda-exploration] and [Video -][eda-exploration-video]
This project visually explores the dataset, and ultimately finds what really matters in selling your home, if you live in King County, based on historical data.

### Fort Worth Gem and Mineral Club
- [Gem and Mineral Property Discussion on Color -][FWGMC-color-video]
In this presentation I walked the club members through how to find their favored gems and minerals based on its color. There is a brief overview of some of the chemistry, physics, and biochemistry involved in the perception of that color.

# 2018

### Sunnyvale High School

- [Short Graphing Video -][short-graphing-video]
This video was created for my regular physics students after the completion of an acceleration lab. The video details how to generate a chart with an equation and R-squared value to be used in analysis. The video was created using the school provided technology so that students would be able to replicate what was necessary readily.

- [Demo Video to Draw in Solidworks -][dragster-body-demo]
This video was created for my introduction to engineering students and was recorded live in class so that my students would be able to reference the content later. This was their first time working with the software Solidworks in any depth.

- [Demo Video to Draw a Wheel in Solidworks -][dragster-wheel-demo]
This video was created for introduction to engineering students to demonstrate some basic tools and challenge them to explore some additional tools on their own.


### Moisés E. Molina High School
- [Long Graphing Video -][long-graphing-video]
This video was created for my forensic science students after the completion of a footwear impression lab. The video describes the steps that I wanted my students to take to complete an analysis for their lab and moves step by step through which buttons to click.
